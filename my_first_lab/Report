The connection establishment is similar for the UDP case and the TCP case, the differencies are between the data exchange and the connection closing because for the TCP case the protocol need to send the packet with the message and has to wait until it got back an ACK instead for the UDP protocol things are different because the latter can send multiple information without receiving anything. On the connection closing things are different because TCP send one last message and expects one last ACK and when the connection is closed it's impossible to senf anything while with UDP there isn't a final message but if we close the connection the sender can still send one more message but it will receive a packet of the ICMP protocol with the info "Destination unreachable" because the connectio was previously closed but the sender didn't know it.
